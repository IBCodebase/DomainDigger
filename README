This program is a crawler that visually represents connected subdirectories as a directed node graph. The general
goal of this approach is to display the structure of a website in a way that anyone could understand; at the 
minimum, it is a cool way to show how a seemingly simple website can in reality be a complex web of interconnected
subdirectories. 
It is not difficult to use, simply run the program and enter a url. 
I specifically made it incompatible with some high level domain types such as .mil- if you really want to try your
luck the code is easy to change, but I do not recomend doing this. I left .gov as a viable option, but added an 
additional varification, as that again is not something you want to accidentally do.

There will also be attatched examples of what the graphs look like. You can choose if you would like to have url
labels, but for larger graphs I do not recomend it (it becomes very messy).

Thanks for checking my project out!
